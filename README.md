What this project should teach you:



How to use git in a group environment

Using variadic functions in a large-scale undertaking

The intricate details of printf

Finding a good workflow and handling a large number of files

USAGE
Prints a string to the standard output, according to a given format
All files were created and compiled on Ubuntu 14.04.4 LTS using GCC 4.8.4 with the command gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic *.c
Returns the number of characters in the output string on success, -1 otherwise
Call it this way: _printf("format string", arguments...) where format string can contain conversion specifiers and flags, along with regular characters
